Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission from the Copernicus Programme that systematically acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolution (10 m to 60 m) over land and coastal waters. The mission is a constellation with two twin satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B.

* The mission supports a broad range of services and applications such as agricultural monitoring, emergencies management, land cover classification or water quality.

* Sentinel-2 has been developed and is being operated by ESA, and the satellites were manufactured by a consortium led by Airbus DS.

* The  aim  of  land  use and land cover classification is to automatically provide labels describing  the  represented  physical  land  type  or  how  a  land area is used (e.g., residential, industrial). 

* EuroSAT  dataset  consists  of  **27,000**  labeled  images  with  10 different land use and land cover classes.

* Sentinel-2A  is one  satellite  in  the  two-satellite  constellation  of  the  identical land  monitoring  satellites  Sentinel-2A  and  Sentinel-2B.  The satellites  were  successfully  launched  in  June  2015  (Sentinel-2A)  and  March  2017  (Sentinel-2B).   

* The  two-satellite  constellation generates a coverage of almost the entire Earthâ€™s land surface about every five days.

To  construct  an  image classification dataset, we performed the following two steps:
1. Satellite Image Acquisition: We gathered satellite images of  European  cities  distributed  in  over  34  countries.

2. Dataset Creation: Based on the obtained satellite images, we created a dataset of 27,000 georeferenced and labeled image patches. The image patches measure 64x64 pixels and have been manually checked. 

The  covered  cities  are  distributed  over  the  34  Euro-pean  countries:  **Austria,  Belarus,  Belgium,  Bulgaria,  Cyprus,Czech Republic (Czechia), Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy / Holy See,Latvia,  Lithuania,  Luxembourg,  Macedonia,  Malta,  Republicof Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and United Kingdom.**

In  order  to  **improve**  the  chance  of  getting  valuable  image patches,  we  selected  satellite  images  with  a  low  cloud  level. Besides the possibility to generate a cloud mask, ESA provides a cloud level value for each satellite image allowing to quickly select  images  with  a  low  percentage  of  clouds  covering  theland scene. 

We  have  chosen  10  different and use and land cover classes based on the principle that theyshowed to be visible at the resolution of 10 meters per pixel.

**Aplications:**
1. Land Use and Land Cover Change Detection
2. Assistance in Mapping
3. Deforestation is a main contributor to climate change, therefore the detection of deforested land isof particular interest (e.g., to notice illegal clearing of forests).
